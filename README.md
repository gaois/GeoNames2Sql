# GeoNames2Sql

GeoNames2Sql is a tool built by the Gaois research group at [Fiontar & Scoil na Gaeilge](https://www.gaois.ie), Dublin City University, Ireland to import Gazetteer data from the [GeoNames geographical database](http://www.geonames.org/) and store it in a SQL Server instance. It is essentially an abstraction over the excellent [NGeoNames](https://github.com/RobThree/NGeoNames) library, adding a Command-line Interface and the tools to generate a SQL database.
